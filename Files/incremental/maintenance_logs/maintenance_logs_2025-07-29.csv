I've tried to tighten them but it doesn't seem to be making a difference. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the issue so I can finish my ride safely."

I've only had the bike for an hour and I'm already having to stop frequently to add air. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look at it and fix the issue as soon as possible."
