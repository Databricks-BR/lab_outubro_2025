I've tried to tighten them but it doesn't seem to be making a difference. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the issue so I can finish my ride safely."

I'm having to squeeze the brake levers really hard to get any response, which is kinda scary. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the issue ASAP."

I noticed the issue as soon as I started riding and I'm worried it could cause problems, especially at night. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the reflectors as soon as possible."
