I noticed the issue as soon as I started riding and I'm worried it could cause problems, especially at night. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the reflectors as soon as possible."

I've tried to tighten it, but it doesn't seem to be staying in place. Can I get a replacement or have this one fixed ASAP?"
