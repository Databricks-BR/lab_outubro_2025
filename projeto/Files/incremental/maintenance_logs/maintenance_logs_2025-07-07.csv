I've only had the bike for an hour and I'm already having to stop frequently to add air. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look at it and fix the issue as soon as possible."

I'm having to squeeze the brake levers really hard to get any response, which is kinda scary. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the issue ASAP."
