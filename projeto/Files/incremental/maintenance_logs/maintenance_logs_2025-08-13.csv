I've tried to tighten them but it doesn't seem to be making a difference. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the issue so I can finish my ride safely."

I'm having to squeeze the brake levers really hard to get any response, which is kinda scary. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the issue ASAP."

I've tried to tighten it, but it doesn't seem to be staying in place. Can I get a replacement or have this one fixed ASAP?"
