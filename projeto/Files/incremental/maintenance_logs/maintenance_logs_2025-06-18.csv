I'm having to squeeze the brake levers really hard to get any response, which is kinda scary. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the issue ASAP."

I've tried adjusting it, but it doesn't seem to be staying in place. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the issue so I can continue my ride."
