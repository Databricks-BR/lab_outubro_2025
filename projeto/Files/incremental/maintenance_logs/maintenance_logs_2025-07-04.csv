I noticed the issue as soon as I started riding and I'm worried it could cause problems, especially at night. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the reflectors as soon as possible."

I've tried to tighten it, but it doesn't seem to be staying in place. Can I get a replacement or have this one fixed ASAP?"

I'm having to squeeze the brake levers really hard to get any response, which is kinda scary. I'd appreciate it if someone could take a look and fix the issue ASAP."
